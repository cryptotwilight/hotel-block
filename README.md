# hotel-block
This is the hotel block repository. Hotel block is a new blockchain based platform that enables hotels to sell their inventory as tradeable NFTs. 
<br/> This allows for better booking policies as now customers will be able to simply sell their bookings on the open market rather than cancel them. 
<br/> It also enables other more exciting features such as hotel managed price control to combat booking touts and it enables hotels to gain revenue through each exchange.
